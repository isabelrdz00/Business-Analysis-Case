## Healthcare Case: Riverwood Health Clinic
### Project Overview
- This project focuses on implementing an integrated appointment scheduling solution for the Riverwood Health Clinic. The purpose is to streamline the appointment scheduling process, reduce patient no-shows, and improve overall patient satisfaction. The new scheduling system is designed to integrate seamlessly with the clinic’s existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, thereby reducing administrative workload and enhancing patient experience.

### Objectives
- Implement a scheduling solution that integrates with the clinic’s EHR system.
- Reduce patient no-shows from 20% to 10% within the first 6 months.
- Minimize administrative time spent on scheduling by 30%.
- Improve patient satisfaction scores related to appointment scheduling from 75% to 90%.

### Key Features
- Automated Scheduling and Reminders: Automated appointment booking, confirmation, and follow-up reminders to reduce no-show rates.
- Self-Service Portal: A patient portal that allows for online appointment booking, modifications, and cancellations.
- Real-Time EHR Integration: Integration with the existing EHR system to ensure accurate and up-to-date patient information.
- Reporting and Analytics: Detailed reporting on scheduling efficiency, patient no-show rates, and overall patient satisfaction.
